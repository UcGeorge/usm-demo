# USM Demo

Welcome to USM Demo, a web application that showcases visualizations of six different uninformed search methods. This application is built using Flutter and provides an interactive way to understand and compare various search algorithms.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the application: [USM Demo](https://ucgeorge.github.io/usm-demo)

## Features

- Visualizations of six different uninformed search methods:
  1. Depth-First Search (DFS)
  2. Depth-Limited Search (DLS)
  3. Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
  4. Breath-First Search (BFS)
  5. Bidirectional Search (BIDI)
  6. Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)
  
- Customizable graph inputs: You can create your own graph by specifying nodes, edges, and weights.

- Step-by-step visualization: Each search algorithm is demonstrated step-by-step, allowing you to observe how the search progresses.

- Statistics and analysis: The application provides statistics such as the number of nodes expanded, path cost, and search time, enabling you to compare the performance of different algorithms.
